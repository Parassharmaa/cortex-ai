Overwatch World Cup: Katowice Qualifier Day 3 Survival Guide
I hate Doomfist
Who else thinks that getting oneshot by doomfist is way more frustrating than getting oneshot by the old roadhog?
Uh, This shouldn't be a thing, Right..?
In my dreams I'm dying all the time ♫
Healers should be able to have an "I'm dead" voice line
My idea and mockup for a combined Play of the Game Highlight Intro system
DV.A's whole mech should be gold if I buy her golden weapon
Zenyatta Buff Idea
My drunk girlfriend made genji with water paint
Mercy goes the extra mile to keep me alive
+100 points for style!
Buying a golden torb gun should make his turrets gold as well.
I think Road's still in the meta...right?
I met Cara Theobold recently
Anyone else dying for the new Summer Games skins to get leaked?
Blizzard gave me Man'O'War headset for cheering for Poland the loudest today in Katowice
When your team gives up on the first point, so you have to do it all yourself
I drew Sparrow Genji! ^u^
Is that a new Symmetra's Victory Pose?
Blizzard never said they wanted to get rid of One shots.
If a particular hero is giving you a lot of trouble sometimes the best way to learn how to play against them is to practice as them.
Can anyone explain this?? Jeff??
Reaper briefly felt the cold icy hand of death
When the squad tries to flank
"I trusted you Dva, now you've gotta pay"
Seems like Bethesda are a fan of OW too.
So people keep suggesting stuff for when the healer is dead
Junkrat emotes but with tracking
Butt clenching moment : Lucio Edition
I Accidentally Found a Reproducible Game-Breaking Mei Exploit
I'm working on a new way to find groups and scrims, looking for feedback and help testing once we go live!
Played my first comp game and got an ult I'm proud of
What a great community
Tracer &amp; Windows VA friendly banter
Orisa has a "Fist Bump" line after a Melee kill.
I love Doomfist
The worst kind of res
If You Want A Support/Tank Go Pick One!
Calvin with a 3K to save the point!
At least Zenyatta tried...
The big bang.
Can we get a cinematic where Tracer actually lands shots on something?
Totally planned and coordinated
Rick teleports to the Horizon Lunar Colony and rescues Winston
Everyone on the enemy team left... So we posed to give Lucio a picturesque POTG
Sometimes your enemies line up just right
Game breaking reinhardt bug
Flanking zen tactic
What a game between Canada and Russia.
Agilities Insane 5 Kill Blade
Request: Can we please have another double XP weekend for the last week of summer games
Widow POTG 5 kills, 4 HS kills
I'm absolutely sure this is the right answer
My only regret is that I didn't emote
I revised my concept for an evil support character based on your feedback: meet Rhea v2
Water coloured Lucio
Tracer doesn't need a buff, but I've got an idea for one anyway
LEGO Health Packs - Overwatch
Reinhardt brand vacuum cleaner - sucks Mercy from hard-to-reach corners
Healer Vision should be available to all heroes
Tracer can pulse bomb Doomfist's ult
After playing this game for 1.5 years, I finally got legitimate rapid discord.
Why are people complaining about Doomfist?
Glow in the dark skins got me thinkin...
Doomfist is a well-balanced hero
Thanks Reinhardt
Unfairness between Concole and PC changes
I really did not expect that
How Skins Glow In The Dark (The Collection!)
1% Skill. 99% luck.
Remember when.....? (A reflection on 1 year of overwatch, feel free to add)
Does anyone else find this fun?
Playing Mystery Heroes over Competitive/QP mode has been the best decision I've ever made
"I can feel their pain, anguish and despair...and i like it" mei the ice witch.
Not sure if intentional or accidental, but I got pushed into a locked spawn zone on Anubis and couldn't get out. Possibly a map exploit. Anyone else have this problem?
Sombra Render by my friend: Calszonee Link is in the description
I think Sombra needs an exorcism
"I want to teleport to this rock" - said no Reaper ever.... aka Reaper's rock
Winston's new skin idea.
Junkrat Chibi! (art by me)
Junkrat has a current rip-tire glitch (X-Post from r/junkratmains)
A fun Easter egg for SF fans in the Horizon Lunar Colony map
The Importance of a Good Headset
Had something weird happen as Doomfist on Hanamura
When your Genji still wants healing
I enjoy checking out low subscriber YouTubers and found this gold
Why is there no confirmation for Competitive Queue?
Managed to snag POTG and a clip making an almost seamless transition
I didn't believe this ult would work
When the Zarya ult on point 👌
New passive ability for Orisa
Blizzard should add voice lines for when Ana sleep darts an enemy ult.
WC Casters Spend Too Much Time on r/prequelmemes
Zarya the true PoTG though
If you could remove/change one thing from Overwatch, what would it be?
Pain is an excellent teacher
I'm relatively new to overwatch and would like to know the current meta (consensus on certain characters, compositions, etc.)
Roller coaster of emotions...
Frame rate drops since the last update?
Why I hate seeing a Widowmaker in 3v3
